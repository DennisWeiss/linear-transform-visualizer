# Linear Transform Visualizer

This tool visualizes linear transformation of type $\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ in a cartesian coordinate system.

## Features

The base vectors $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ can be moved and produce a $\mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$ matrix accordingly. Determinant, inverse matrix and null space is also computed.
